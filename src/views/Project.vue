            <br><br>
            Axios is an HTTP client library based on 
            promises. It makes sending asynchronous HTTP 
            requests to REST endpoints easier and helps you perform CRUD operations. This REST endpoint/API could be an external API like the Google API, GitHub API, and so on â€“ or it could be your own backend Node.

            Vuetify is a full-featured UI framework built on Vue.js. The project's goal is to give developers the tools
            they need to create rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Vuetify is built from the
            ground up to be simple to learn and rewarding to master, with hundreds of carefully crafted Material Design
            components.
